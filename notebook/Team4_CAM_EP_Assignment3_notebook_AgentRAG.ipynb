    "# Agent RAG System - Functionality Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the different functionalities implemented in our Agent RAG system for analyzing bank documents and PRA rulebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system consists of three main components:\n",
    "1. **Document Ingestion Pipeline** - Processing and storing PDF documents\n",
    "2. **Facts Retrieval System** - Querying knowledge from Neo4j graph database  \n",
    "3. **Agent Framework** - Interactive assistant with specialized tools and prompts\n"

    "\n",
    "## 1. Document Ingestion Pipeline (`pdf_processor.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The document ingestion system is responsible for processing PDF documents and extracting structured knowledge that can be stored and retrieved efficiently. The main entry point is the `preproc_bank_documents()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document Processing Workflow\n",
    "1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PyPDF2 to extract raw text from each page\n",
    "2. **Image Screenshot Generation**: Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) to create high-quality screenshots of each page\n",
    "3. **Best Representation Detection**: AI-powered analysis to determine whether a page is better represented as text or image. Using image representation is especially relevant when information is postional and requires to understand the structure of the page (e.g: for slides or tables)\n",
    "4. **Content Summarization**: Generates summaries for both individual pages and entire documents\n",
    "5. **Fact Extraction**: Extracts structured facts from document content\n",
    "6. **Embedding Generation**: Creates vector embeddings for semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Using OCR with agents should be monitored carefully especially for non-text data - when LLM performs well at word level, they tend to hallucinate characters for references or numbered data. A potential mitigation \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Classes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document Class methods**:\n",
    "- `setup_from_path()`: Main processing method that handles PDF parsing and screenshot generation\n",
    "- `generate_document_summaries()`: Creates AI-generated summaries of document content\n",
    "- `detect_best_representation()`: Determines optimal representation (text vs image) for each page\n",
    "- `generate_document_1stfacts()`: Extracts structured facts from document content\n",
    "- `embed_document_facts()`: Generates embeddings for all extracted facts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Page Class**:\n",
    "- Stores text content, images, summaries, keywords, and embeddings for individual pages\n",
    "- Links to extracted facts and their associated questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact Class**:\n",
    "- Represents structured knowledge with associated questions\n",
    "- Includes embedding vectors for semantic similarity matching\n",
    "- Connected to source pages and documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI-Powered Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The system leverages OpenAI's GPT models (gpt5-nano) for several intelligent processing tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best Representation Analysis**: Determines whether pages with tables, graphs, or complex layouts should be processed as images rather than text\n",
    "- **Content Summarization**: Generates concise summaries while preserving key information\n",
    "- **Fact Extraction**: Identifies and structures important factual information from documents. This approach is preferred to traditional text chunking as it enables to generate 'ready_to_use' information instead of non-coherent chunks.  \n",
    "- **Question Generation**: Creates relevant questions that each fact can answer. These questions are generated to facilate retrieval and anticipate the kind of questions that can be asked on this document. It assumes that the main input for retrieval will be a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling and Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exponential Backoff Retry**: Implements robust retry logic for API calls with exponential backoff\n",
    "- **Async Processing**: Uses asynchronous operations for efficient concurrent processing ()\n",
    "- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing documents in Neo4j to avoid reprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The processed documents are stored in a Neo4j graph database with the following structure:\n",
    "- **CORPUS** nodes: Represent collections of documents (e.g., by bank)\n",
    "- **DOCUMENT** nodes: Individual PDF files with metadata and summaries\n",
    "- **PAGE** nodes: Individual pages with text, summaries, and embeddings\n",
    "- **FACT** nodes: Extracted factual information with embeddings and associated questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Process documents from a folder\n",
    "await preproc_bank_documents(\n",
    "    folder_path=\"data/Barclays\",\n",
    "    file_list=[\"annual_report_2023.pdf\", \"risk_assessment.pdf\"],\n",
    "    focus=\"risk management\",\n",
    "    fact_label=\"FACT\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ingestion pipeline ensures that documents are pre-processed consistently and stored for retrieval and analysis by the agent system.\n",

    "## 2. Facts Retrieval System (Neo4j Queries)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The facts retrieval system enables semantic search and retrieval of relevant information from the knowledge graph stored in Neo4j. The main component is the `GraphProcessor` class in `process_graph.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GraphProcessor Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GraphProcessor` class provides the main interface for querying the knowledge graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Methods**:\n",
    "- `query_graph()`: Primary method for semantic search across the knowledge base\n",
    "- `embed_input()`: Generates embeddings for user queries using OpenAI's embedding models\n",
    "- `find_existing_node()`: Checks for existing nodes to prevent duplicates\n",
    "- `get_document_with_descriptions()`: Retrieves document metadata and descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Query Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrieval system uses sophisticated Cypher queries that combine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Similarity Search**: Computes cosine similarity between query embeddings and stored fact/page embeddings\n",
    "2. **Hybrid Scoring**: Combines fact-level and page-level similarity scores for more accurate results\n",
    "3. **Corpus Filtering**: Allows filtering by specific document collections (banks, PRA rulebooks)\n",
    "4. **Relevance Thresholding**: Filters results based on minimum similarity scores\n",
    "5. **Result Limiting**: Controls the number of facts returned per document and total facts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Search Process\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def query_graph(self, question: str, threshold: float = 0.6, \n",
    "                     doc_limit: int = None, total_fact_limit: int = None):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step Process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Embedding**: Convert user question to vector representation using `text-embedding-3-large`\n",
    "2. **Graph Traversal**: Navigate through FACT → PAGE → DOCUMENT → CORPUS relationships\n",
    "3. **Similarity Computation**: Calculate cosine similarity between query and stored embeddings\n",
    "4. **Hybrid Scoring**: Combine fact and page similarities: `(similarity_fact + similarity_page)/2`\n",
    "5. **Filtering & Ranking**: Apply threshold filtering and sort by relevance\n",
    "6. **Result Structuring**: Group facts by document with metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neo4j Graph Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge graph follows this structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CORPUS ← [] - DOCUMENT ← [] - PAGE ← [QUESTION (relationships)] - FACT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Node Types**:\n",
    "- **CORPUS**: Document collections (e.g., \"Barclays\", \"PRA_Rulebook\")\n",
    "- **DOCUMENT**: Individual PDF files with summaries and metadata\n",
    "- **PAGE**: Document pages with text content and embeddings\n",
    "- **FACT**: Extracted factual information with embeddings\n",
    "- **QUESTION**: Relationships linking facts to questions they can answer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced Query Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Corpus Filtering**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "CORPUS = {\n",
    "    \"included\": [\"Barclays\", \"HSBC\"],  # Only search these banks\n",
    "    \"excluded\": [\"PRA_Rulebook\"]       # Exclude PRA documents\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Limiting**:\n",
    "- `doc_limit`: Maximum number of documents to return\n",
    "- `total_fact_limit`: Maximum total facts across all documents\n",
    "- Per-document fact limiting through Cypher query optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The system returns structured results through specialized classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieved_fact Class**:\n",
    "- `page_id`, `page_name`: Source page information\n",
    "- `fact_id`, `fact`: The actual factual content\n",
    "- `question`: Associated question the fact answers\n",
    "- `similarity`: Relevance score (0-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval_by_document Class**:\n",
    "- `document_summary`: AI-generated document overview\n",
    "- `relevant_facts`: List of retrieved facts from this document\n",
    "- `max_similarity`: Highest similarity score in this document\n",
    "- `document_name`, `corpus_name`: Source identification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval_overall Class**:\n",
    "- Aggregates results across all documents\n",
    "- Provides methods for result persistence and formatting\n",
    "- Enables answer storage back to the knowledge graph\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Indexing**: Neo4j vector indexes for fast similarity search\n",
    "2. **Query Optimization**: Efficient Cypher queries with proper ordering and limiting\n",
    "3. **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations for better responsiveness\n",
    "4. **Connection Pooling**: Reusable database connections\n",
    "5. **Result Caching (non implemented yet)**: Potential for caching frequently accessed results by persisting questions that were sucessfully answered as a new `FACT`. The graph structure would then allow for this new FACT to be connected to multiple pages (going beyond 1-page-facts)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Basic semantic search\n",
    "results = await graph_processor.query_graph(\n",
    "    question=\"What are the capital requirements for banks?\",\n",
    "    threshold=0.7,\n",
    "    total_fact_limit=20\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filtered search within specific banks\n",
    "results = await graph_processor.query_graph(\n",
    "    question=\" a question on bank based on which employee needs information\",\n",
    "    CORPUS={\"included\": [\"Barclays\"]},\n",
    "    doc_limit=5\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieval system enables the agent to access relevant factual information efficiently, supporting both broad exploratory queries and specific targeted searches across the knowledge base.\n"

    "### System Prompt & Conversation Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent follows a structured conversation flow designed for regulatory investigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent Role\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are the Bank of England Docs Assistant, assistant employee investigating \n",
    "documentation from banks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structured Conversation Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Question Collection**\n",
    "- Gather employee questions about bank documentation\n",
    "- Use `get_docs_descriptions_tool` if employee asks about available content\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: PRA Enhancement** \n",
    "- Use `RAG_tool_pra` to retrieve relevant PRA rules and regulations\n",
    "- Enhance the employee's question with regulatory context\n",
    "- Present PRA information to employee before proceeding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Bank Document Analysis**\n",
    "- Use `RAG_tool_banks` to search for information in bank documents\n",
    "- Break large questions into smaller, focused queries\n",
    "- Create an \"audit plan\" based on PRA information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Iterative Refinement**\n",
    "- Ask \"Refine or check anything else?\" to continue investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Instructions & Behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Information Integrity\n",
    "- **Answer ONLY from the corpus** using approved tools\n",
    "- **Never use external facts** or make up information\n",
    "- If information is not in the corpus, explicitly state so\n",
    "- If tools fail, acknowledge the failure rather than fabricating responses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Query Processing Strategy\n",
    "- **Prioritize facts by relevance**, focusing on most relevant information first\n",
    "- **Separate large questions** into smaller, focused queries for better results\n",
    "- **Synthesize PRA information** into a series of targeted questions for bank document searches\n",
    "- **Always answer employee** after PRA enhancement before proceeding to bank document searches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Response Formatting\n",
    "The agent returns structured JSON responses with specific formatting rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"Conversational and synthetic response\",\n",
    "    \"relevant_fact_ids\": {\n",

    "        \"BANK\": [\"fact_id_3\", \"fact_id_4\"]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formatting Guidelines**:\n",
    "- **Conversational tone**: Responses should be natural and synthetic\n",
    "- **Focused content**: Keep answers focused on essential facts only\n",
    "- **Fact ID tracking**: Store IDs of facts used to generate responses\n",
    "- **Length limits**: Short answers (≤120 words) when not using RAG tools\n",
    "- **Language mirroring**: Match the employee's language style\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AsyncConversation Class\n",
    "Manages conversation state and message history:\n",
    "- `Client_prompt_class`: Stores user messages with timestamps\n",
    "- `Bot_answer_class`: Stores agent responses with timestamps\n",

    "### User Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The system provides two interaction modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Command Line Interface (`conversation_process()`)\n",
    "- Interactive terminal-based conversation\n",
    "- Detailed logging and reasoning step stored in `/chatbot_logs` for debugging (especially to check tool calling)\n",
    "- Suitable for development and debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize conversation system\n",
    "graph_processor = GraphProcessor()\n",
    "conversation = AsyncConversation(graph_processor)\n",
    "agent, system_prompt = conversation.build_agent(\"gpt-4\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process user input\n",
    "user_input = \"What are the capital adequacy requirements for UK banks?\"\n",
    "response = await agent.run(user_msg=user_input, max_iterations=10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent framework provides a sophisticated, tool-enabled assistant that can navigate complex regulatory and financial documentation while maintaining conversation context and ensuring information accuracy.\n",

    "## System Integration & Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The three components work together to create a comprehensive document analysis system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Ingestion** → **Knowledge Graph Storage** → **Agent Retrieval & Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intelligent Processing**: AI-powered document analysis with best representation detection\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based similarity matching for accurate information retrieval  \n",
    "- **Regulatory Context**: Integration of PRA rulebooks with bank document analysis\n",
    "- **Structured Conversation**: Guided investigation flow for systematic document review\n",
    "- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles large document collections with efficient querying\n",
    "- **Multi-Modal Support**: Processes both text and visual document elements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Async Processing**: Efficient concurrent operations throughout the pipeline\n",
    "- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive retry logic and graceful error handling\n",
    "- **Graph Database**: Neo4j provides flexible, relationship-rich data storage\n",
    "- **Extensible data form**: Modular architecture allows for easy `FACT` additions -> (non-impelemnted yet) Agent could keep memory of previously generated questions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This system enables Bank of England employees to efficiently investigate and analyze complex financial documentation while ensuring regulatory compliance and maintaining high standards of information accuracy.\n"
